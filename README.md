## Rachel's Spacestagram

Welcome Earthlings! 

### Goal

Develop a webpage that can fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs, display the resulting images and details, and allow users to “like” and “unlike” their favourite posts. This app also allows users to share images via text,email,link,reddit etc. 

This was a fun challenge for me! Be sure to check out the deployed app @ https://rachel-spacestagram.herokuapp.com
